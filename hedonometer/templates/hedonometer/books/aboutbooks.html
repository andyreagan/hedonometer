	  <h3>Happiness of Stories: Over 10,000 Books in Many Languages</h3>
	  <p>We present the analysis of the books from Project Gutenberg, <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
	  <h3>Example</h3>
	  <p>Break down a particular book, in the new app. Also link to the old app?</p>
	  <h3>Methodology</h3>
	  <p>To analyze each book, we first break down the full text into 1,000 word segments. From there, a timeseries is created by joining 10 segments to create a window containing 10,000 words, and sliding this window across the book.</p>  
	  <p>The dashed lines at the start and end of the timeseries correspond to the non-symmetric window, where only the right/left half was available.</p>  
	  <p>For details on the hedonometer instrument itself, see the <a href="/instructions.html">instructions page</a>.</p>
